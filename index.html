        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Anais Lopez Pease. I am a full-stack web developer, graduate from Arizona State University. I am a first generation Mexican-American woman. Born and raised in San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, California. I have been passionate about
            web development since I was fourteen, and was a member of the website club in my high school.<br> I married a military man and had the opportunity to travel and live in many different place. Including Waihiawa, Hawaii. During that time I work
            in finance at a bank and then in the higher education sector for a little over a decade. Then Covid happened. Like many people around the world it put a lot of things into perspective. One being that, although I loved my team and enjoyed my
            work I was not excited about it.<br> I decided to go back to college and obtain a degree in something that will allow me to be creative as well as a creator.</p>
